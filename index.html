      <h3>Here is a timeline of  Marlon Brando's Life</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Marlon Brando Jr.</strong>  (April 3, 1924 â€“ July 1, 2004) </li>
        <li> American actor and film director with a career spanning 60 years, during which he won the Academy Award for Best Actor twice. He is regarded as arguably the greatest and most influential actor in 20th-century film.</li>
        <li>Brando was also an <strong>activist</strong> for many causes, notably the civil rights movement and various Native American movements.</li>
        <li>He initially gained acclaim and an <strong>Academy Award nomination</strong> for reprising the role of Stanley Kowalski in the 1951 film adaptation of Tennessee Williams' play A Streetcar Named Desire, a role that he originated successfully on Broadway.</li>
        <li>The 1960s saw Brando's career take a commercial and critical downturn. He directed and starred in the cult western One-Eyed Jacks, a critical and commercial flop, after which he delivered a series of notable box-office failures, beginning with Mutiny on the Bounty (1962).</li>
        <li> After ten years of underachieving, he agreed to do a screen test as Vito Corleone in Francis Ford Coppola's <strong>The Godfather (1972)</strong>.</li>
